- Start the battle cursor in appropriate places

* Debug the "crystal and darin will resolve their attacks simultaneously" problem.

- Figure out why the battle menu is corrupting in any circumstance other than a fresh load.

* After that I'll start in on some basic effects, like item use - Herb. 
  Some pose changes and a simple sparlie overlay, and +30 HP. This'll be a testbed
  for working out the battle effect process, which I hope to fully document sometime
  soon so anyone who wants to, can add content to Sully in the near future.

* After a few battle effects are in, then it's time to implement the Status effects, 
  which is twofold: one: implementing a triggering system for cleanup (on_death, on_hit,
  expiry_time, etc etc), and two: actually putting the checks for various status 
  ailments in the right places.

* After that, making sure that the proper special animations/poses occur when a character
  is effected by a status ailment, and making sure they're removed when the ailment is removed.

* After that, just some mundane fixes (McFAIL needs a deadzone time on button presses,
  McGrender needs to be fully debugged since some render layers are missing on battle reloads,
  The Battle Menu parser needs to be kicked some so it always loads the right data on startup...)

* And then, content. Whee.

=========================================

* Create some animation stubs for Item Use and General Spell Effects.
	* Create a function that can tell if a sprite has reached the end of a custom animation cycle or not.
		*Tweak the sprite-handler in the McGrender engine so it can optionally hold certain frames until told to release.

* tweak the selection-map library for battle mode.  Make it so a left-click when on the ally side goes to "enemy 1", and any offensive ability starts targetting on "enemy 1".
	"Enemy 1" is the rightmost, topmost enemy.

* implement end-of-action checks (status ailments, check for death, etc) (in AreBattleEffectsRendering() maybe???)

* Implement Herb healing.

* Implement Heal Sparklies!

- Implement Basic attack from menu.

* Implement other basic functions. (Run, defend, masturbate, etc)

* Lay out explicitly in a tutorial how to create functions for battleskills.

- QUERY: was this fixed with the base_page clearing fix?
-
- TOTAL HACKAROUND, FIX THIS: Fix the problem where the battle menu fucking breaks in-battle if the dump_bm() call isn't made within battle_menu.vc::TurnBattleMenuOn();

* Modify McFail to have an optional longer "dead" period when in joystick mode.

* loading a new game does not reset previously loaded partymember chrs.  If you load an overworld save, and then load a town/dungeon save, you still have the overworld chrs.

* Fix all volumes!

* implement a letter in the sprite definition files to mean "stop".  For the end of Death, Stone, and other non-repeating poses.

* After that I'll reactivate the slashies, which now means defining a 
  slash for every monster and ally. But since there'll be a lot of reuse, 
  I'm fine by that. It's mainly an excersize in altering the datafile parsers.

========================================

* Make a blue font in the bouncytext for MP changes?

* Seperate the evade/hit animations from the battle_damage_queue?

* Add a "recieving positive effect" stance? (opposite of 'hit')
