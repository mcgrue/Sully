// Equip.dat

//
//
// Here's the format for a equipment entry:
//
// EQUIPMENT_NAME
// CLASS_1, CLASS_2, CLASS_3
// EQUIP_SLOT
// STAT_1 MODVAL 
// STAT_2 MODVAL
// ...
// STAT_N MODVAL
// -
//
// To explain:
// The first line of an equipment entry must be the item we're defining the 
//   equipment values for.  This must be the name of an item in Items.dat.
// The second line is a comma separated list of the classes that can equip 
//   this item. The classes must be valid class names defined in Class.dat.
//   As a special-case token, You may specify ALL_CLASSES if every class can
//   equip this item.
// The third line is the slot this piece of equipment can be equipped in.  In 
//   this release, the only slots are LEFT_HAND, RIGHT_HAND, BODY, and 
//   ACCESSORY.  Note that in this release there are two accessory slots and 
//   anything that is an ACCESSORY can be equipped in *either* slot.
// The fourth line, and each subsequent line until the equipment terminator 
//   line is reached is a  modvalue line.  This takes a stat abbreviation, 
//   some whitespace, and a value.  When a piece of equipment is equipped, the
//   character's stats alter by that value, and when that equipment is removed,
//   they alter by the negative of that value. 
//   At this time, the stats allowed are hardcoded.  The following list shows 
//   the valid stat tokens:
//   
//   MAX_HP, MAX_MP, STR, END, MAG, MGR, HIT, DOD, STK, FER, REA, CTR, ATK, DEF
//
//   Also note that the default equipment code will not allow a character to 
//   equip any equipment that would lower any stat to 0 or less by putting it 
//   on.
//
// An equipment entry ends when you put a lone dash on a line.  Then the system
//   expects to see the next equipment's data afterwards, and the circle of 
//   life continues on.
//
// As a final note, any token, name or otherwise is case-insensitive, and any 
//   blank lines and/or commented lines are ignored as par usual for these
//   datafiles.  Go nuts.
