To Enable the Console In Your Game
====================================
For each map file put V3Console__Init() in your start event.
Or, if maps aren't your thing, slip V3Console__Init() into AutoExec().
Then it should work.

If you have conflicting variable names, feel free to change yours or the ones
in this file. You may want to make the player variable in the console the
same as the one that use for your game.

Using the Command Console
====================================
The command console is summoned by the / (backslash) key. This is because
the standard ` (tilde) key is reserved for fast forward. ALT allows you to
exit from the console.

You basically use it by just typing commands into it. The actual commands will
be detailed below. However, in addition to typing commands, it also supports
the following features:

It's writen in V3 VergeC, so most features from the V2 builtin console were 
lost.

NOTE: Typing a non-command will just log your text instead. 
      That could be useful!

In closing...
====================================

This was just something I thought would be useful for debugging my game.
Something that was built into DOS V2, but was forgotten since.
You may use it in your games and even modify and update it as you see fit.
Mail me at overkill9999@hotmail.com if you see something else that's worth adding.
