* Directionals aren't unpressed when entering a battle
* If you used an item on the last turn in battle, it thinks your new action is an item use as well
* Item descriptions are currently WAY too long for the space provided. 
* There's some weirdness with the battle groups -- some groups trigger errors on fight start, and some groups' enemies bleed into other groups.
