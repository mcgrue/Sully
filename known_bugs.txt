* Directionals aren't unpressed when entering a battle
* Something is up with retargeting actions whose original targets have died
* If you used an item on the last turn in battle, it thinks your new action is an item use as well
* Item descriptions are currently WAY too long for the space provided. 


Also, non-replicated so far, but I had some crazy battle-groups error at one point while wandering around the map.
