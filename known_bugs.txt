* Directionals aren't unpressed when entering a battle
* If you used an item on the last turn in battle, it thinks your new action is an item use as well
* Item descriptions are currently WAY too long for the space provided. 
* There's some weirdness with the battle groups -- some groups trigger errors on fight start, and some groups' enemies bleed into other groups.
* Actions are resolving in the wrong order (something up with the queue, said Grue?)
* Actions that are ineffective on dead targets (which currently means all of them) don't retarget if the original target dies before they happen.
* After your first fight, the party begins every fight doing the victory dance.
