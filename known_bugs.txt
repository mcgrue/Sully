BATTLE SYSTEM

* Directionals pressed at start of battle remain pressed in battle, messing with initial menu input
* If you used an item on the last turn in battle, it thinks your new action is an item use as well
* There's some weirdness with the battle groups -- some groups trigger errors on fight start, and some groups' enemies bleed into other groups.
* Actions are resolving in the wrong order (something up with the queue, said Grue?)
* Under some circumstances, actions whose original targets have died fail to retarget. It doesn't happen very often, but it still happens, oddly.
* After your first fight, the party begins every fight doing the victory dance.
* Wtf is up with that keys.vc error that happens once in a while? It seems to have nothing to do with keys.vc, at least -- I was getting something similar earlier when I was fucking up image handles, so maybe it's related to that.
* Items (and spells?) that can't be used in battle can still be accessed in the battle menus, causing the game to get upset.
* Something is way fucked in the drama clubber fight -- it always freezes on me after a short time. This is the only fight with a setup callfunc -- could that be related?

NON-BATTLE-SYSTEM

* Item descriptions are currently WAY too long for the space provided. 
* Out-of-battle skill usage is broken (or at least Heal is broken). BTW, looking in ExecuteLove it seemed that the battle menu execution gives an error if you try to use something disabled in battle. If I'm right in thinking that, then there could be problems with using the battle menu for out-of-battle skill use.
